# react-wcra

Its a boilerplate react + redux-saga setup to quickly get you up and running. This has been built from the scratch on top of webpack and babel configs. NO Create-react-app has been used. So if you are looking for some redux-saga starter code then you are at the right place. 

### Dependencies

- **React 16.13+**
- **Redux 4.0.1**
- **Redux-saga 1.0.4**
- **Bootstrap 4.3**
- **JS-Cookie 2.2**

### Usage

    $ git clone https://github.com/sprakash57/react-wcra.git
    $ cd react-wcra
    $ npm i and then npm start

### WIP stuff
webpack support for development and production will be added soon.
